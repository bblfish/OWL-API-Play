# OWL-API-Play

[Ammonite](https://ammonite.io/) scripts to explore ontologies like the [Financial Industry Business Ontology (FIBO)](https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/) with the [OWL-API](http://owlcs.github.io/owlapi/).

The OWL-API is an interface for reasoners and Ontology development Apps such as [Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu/). Being able to write scripts when downloading and testing ontologies makes it much easier to explore the OWL-API programmatically as well as the downloaded ontologies.
